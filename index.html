    <h1><b>Team Profiles</b></h1>
    <h2><b>1.1. Team name:GL's</b></h2>
    <h2><b>1.2. Team profile:</b></h2>
      <p>According to my 16 Personalities test, the teammates that I would like to
      work with are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Teammates who are hardworking and trying to complete the assigned work
        on schedule:
      <br>
        This is because the Big five test present that I always try as
        much as possible to get achievement in my goals. Therefore, working with
        these teammates will help me to keep the project on schedule and complete
        the tasks on time as required by the client.
      </li>
      <li>Teammates love to share creatives ideas and opinions without hesitation:
        <br>
        The 16Personalities test showed that I am a kind of person who have vivid
        imagination, while the Big Five test indicated that I have abstract
        thinking due to the high rate of Openness (75 percent). Therefore,
        I believe that sharing creative ideas can help make a project more
        exciting that can attract more people. In addition, different opinions
        of team members can contribute to making the project more comprehensive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Teammates are enthusiastic about solving the obstacles:
        <br>
        Based on my personalities test, I prefer to care and help others rather
        than competing with them, and I am also a good listener. When implementing
        the project, the whole team may face many difficulties. Hence, it is
        crucial to support each other to overcome the challenges because teamwork
        helps solve problems faster and encourages team members to stick together.

    <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
    <h4><b>“IT project for creating the Dashboard for the COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh
       city”</b></h4>
    <h2><b>2.1. Overview</b></h2>
    <p>
      My project aims to build a COVID-19 Dashboard in HCM city using Tableau
      and ArcGIS for this pandemic management. The local authority mainly uses
      this dashboard to
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Track the positive, the recovered, and the death cases and forecast
          this data.</li>
        <li>Report the vaccination data.</li>
        <li>Set the warning level for specific areas in the city.</li>
      </ul>
      The time and the location will depend on the users' choices. Besides
      summarizing data of covid-19 in each region, the dashboard can also help
      urban managers to predict the pandemic trend in a particular period by
      applying machine learning.
    </p>
    <h2><b>2.2. Motivation</b></h2>
    <p>
      Originating from China in the last of 2019, COVID-19 has significantly
      become a tremendous pandemic until the present time. According to
      Worldometers (2021), the daily infectious cases are around 400 000 to
      700 000, while the death cases are about 10 000 - 15 000 per day this
      year. In Vietnam,Ho Chi Minh City has become a hotspot for this pandemic
      disease, with the total number of cases peak at 150 000 and the average
      case number per day is more than 4000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local authority follows these procedures to mitigate several impacts of
      thispandemic, including social distancing, contact tracing, and herd
      immunity. Therules hope to flatten the curve and avoid the hospital bein
      overwhelmed with new cases by doing these steps while waiting for the
      vaccine.  However, the appearance of the Delta variant, which is easier
      to spread and causes several more illnesses in infectious people, seriously
      affects HCM city and thesurrounding areas. The local manager is struggling
      with the new variant and taking many steps to control and prevent this pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I aim to create an effective tool to help the official quickly
      access data, obtain necessary information about the pademic. Moreover,
      this tool also supports them in making predictions for the COVID-19 trend at
      a specific time.By using this dashboard, they can make appropriate decisions
      and policies for each city area.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2><b>2.3. Description</b></h2>
    <h3><i>2.3.1. Graphs</i></h3>
    <p>
      The graph will present this information relevant to the chosen time and
      location.
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>
        The first graph will show the number of positive, recovered, and death
        cases. Officials can use this information to calculate infection rate,
        mortality rate, and recovered rate to decide social distancing measures.
       </li>
       <li>
        The second graph will show the number of conducted COVID-19 tests.
        Officials can use this information to check how many people have been
        tested in the city.
       </li>
       <li>
        The third graph will present the status of contact tracing includes
        comprehensive (contact tracing done for all cases), limited (contact
        tracing not done for all cases), and none (no contact tracing). This
        information will help to check the ability of identifying and monitoring
        COVID-19 patients in each district to control the spread of this pandemic.
       </li>
       <li>
        The next graph will present the data of quarantine and treatment areas
        include size (how many places for the patients) and status (empty or full).
        This information is vital for the official to know the healthcare management
        capacity of each district and hence give the appropriate decisions to
        allocate resources for each one..
       </li>
       <li>
        •	The final graph will show the total number of people who have a vaccine
        (one or two doses) and the vaccination rate are vital for planning vaccination
        supply. This graph also includes the statistical data of different
        vaccine types, such as Astra, Pfizer, Moderna so that the official easily
        distribute the reasonable number of each type for one district.
       </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>2.3.2. Maps</i></h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the map also displays the vaccination coverage for one or two
      doses for each district.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Firstly, the map will show polygons of the whole city and its districts.
         When the user clicks on any district polygon, the corresponding charts
         listed above will show up. The authority can distinguish the safety and
        restricted areas based on this information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Secondly, the map also displays the distribution of treatment areas
        and warehouses in the city, which helps the officials organize patient
        transportation and cure, provide facilities and equipment, as well as
        manage product logistics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, the map also illustrates districts that are classified into
        "green zone" (safety) or "red zones" (dangerous) based on the rate of
        infectious people over a thousand people in specific location. This
        information is helpful for the local government to know the pandemic
        status of each district and take proper actions for each one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, the map also displays the vaccination coverage for one or two
        doses for each district. This map will help the official to see the
        vaccination cover in HCM city.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>2.3.3. Forecast</i></h3>
    <img src="Figure1.png">
    <h4>Figure 1: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death Model (SIRD) (Gounane 2021)</h4>
    <p>
      The susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) (Figure 1) model
      effectively makes a forecast tab of the COVID-19 pademic trend in the coming
       time of each district and the whole city. SIRD is one of the crucial models
       used to analyze COVID-19 data based on four main classes: susceptible,
       infectious, recovered, and death. In addition, it needs three parameters
       for the calculation steps, including the rate of transmission, the rate
       of recovery, and the rate of mortality.
     </p>
     <p>
       The result of the forecast tab mainly consists of charts predicting the
       number of infections, recoveries, and deaths. Each of the charts will
       display a line representing the actual and predicted numbers.
     </p>
    <h2><b>2.4. Tools and Technologies</b></h2>
    <img src="Figure2.png">
    <h4>Figure 2: Tools for creating COVID-19 Dashboard</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tableau: Tableau is a data visualization tool that makes it easy for
        users to understand and use the data for analysis. The user can perform
        data visualization by creating charts, maps, dashboards, and stories
        through simple drag and drop interfaces and data sets already connected
        to Tableau (Ko & Chang 2017, p.349).
      </li>
      <li>
        ArcGIS: Although Tableau is a good tool for data visualization in charts
        and graphs, ArcGIS is considered a more suitable tool for representing
        data in a map (Integrated Informatics Inc. 2018). In addition, some data
        types, such as lines or mix-type geometries, are challenging to display
        in Tableau. Furthermore, ArcGIS has many options for map projection
        suitable for each data type and region, which does not exist in Tableau.
        Therefore, the adequate solution is to incorporate ArcGIS data into
        Tableau to improve data visualization and analysis results (Kumar 2021).
      </li>
      <li>
        R or Python: In data processing, it is necessary to use python before
        importing data into Tableau because python's strength is flexibility and
         speed when working large datasets (Nguyen 2020). Besides Python, R
         is also a powerful software for data processing.
    </ul>
    <h2><b>2.5. Skills Required</b></h2>
    <p>
      Skills to collect, process raw data, and analyse data to get insights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first step is to gather data from multiple official sources,
        including the published and local data. Then, the raw data needs to be
        classified and designed to facilitate the analysis step. It is necessary
        to consult with epidemiologists to create suitable features to get the
        required information for pademic prevention.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Skills in creating maps and charts for data visualization:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is required to gain more skills to use these tools above proficiently
         to develop maps and charts that meet the requirements. The better data
         visualization is, the more efficient data analysis can be.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Skills to use statistical models to analyse data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The application of a computational model is necessary to obtain the
        necessary information and predict the pademic trend, thereby providing
        reasonable plans to mitigate the disease impacts (Pell et al. 2016).
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      Presentation skills, report writing to present project ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is essential to present the project's ideas and urgency to the managers
        and receive suggestions to improve the project.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>2.6. Outcomes</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The project will provide necessary data on the COVID-19 pademic in the
        city for the authority. This data will help managers monitor the evolution
         of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on each city area.
      </li>
      <li>
        The project will predict the pademic trend subsequently; therefore, the
         authority can give appropriate solutions for pademic prevention and
         adaptation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The project will help the officials recognize which districts are at a
        high level of risk and which are safe. Therefore, the authority can make
         better policies for disease treatment, supply and logistics, and
         vaccination for particular areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.7. Feedback from friends</h2>
    <p>
      Huan Nguyen, one of my classmates in Intro to IT, has assumed that my
      project's ideas are not unique because there are many similar projects in
      various online sources. However, from his perspective, he thinks it was a
      realistic and exciting project due to the Covid19 pandemic status in
      Vietnam, and it will become a gift for the community. Huan advised me to
      focus on the design of the project's application because not many existing
      projects are user-friendly. He argues that Tableau and ArcGIS are the most
      popular visualization tools until now, and these tools will be helpful
      to make the user interface's design more modern and promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Khang Le, one of my teammates, said that my project is realistic, clear,
      and organized. However, he commends that I still misunderstood between
      "pandemic" and "epidemic" terms, and I need to distinguish both of them.
      In addition, Khang asked me to add more features to my application, such
      as display more statistics about the quantity and quality of different
      vaccine types. After that, he recommends that I write the description in
      the same order with the information mentioned in the first line so that
      the readers can easily follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agree with Huan's opinion since COVID-19 has become a severe outbreak
      nowadays, and many similar research projects are carried out to prevent
      the spread of this disease. Therefore, it is essential to design my
      application more attractive and friendly to distinguish it from others.
      In addition, Khang's comments are also valuable for me since I need to
      precisely understand the specific terms, adding more statistical data,
      and improve my writing skills to make the project more comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, creating the application for this project is challenging
      for me. The first reason is that COVID-19 data in Vietnam is not easy to
      access; therefore, collecting and preprocessing data for the analysis step
      is an obstacle. The second one is that building a predictive model is
      complicating, and it requires more understanding of Artificial Intelligence,
      Machine Learning, and Statistics. The final one is that I am a freshman
      in the IT field with basic programming skills, so it takes time and
      effort to fulfill my knowledge to build this application. However,
      I believe that I can boost my skill after completing many courses at
      RMIT university and feel confident to develop my idea.
    </p>

    <h1>IT technologies</h1>
    <h2>3.1. Artificial intelligence and machine learning</h2>
    <h3><i>3.1.1. Definition</i></h3>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most developed technologies in
      2021. This technology creates machines that replicate human intelligence
      by ingesting correct information and aiming for self-correction for devices.
      AI includes weak AI, general AI, strong AI depending on the capability
      (Great Learning 2020).
    </p>
    <p>
      Machine learning (ML) is considered a sub-branch of AI. Machine learning
      consists of Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement
      Learning. While AI creates intelligent computer systems to perform complex
       tasks, ML allows computers to learn from data and provide more accurate
       output (Moné 2017). In summary, AI creates machines while ML improves them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them are more and more widely used and have a strong influence on
      human life. According to Marr (2018), some popular fields are currently
      applying AI technology are manufacturing, healthcare, natural sciences,
      economics and finance, education, transportation, and services (Marr 2018).
      There are some examples of AI applications in real life, such as Automation,
       Vision, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, and Self-driving Cars.
    </p>
    <img src="Figure3.png">
    <h4>Figure 3: AI applications in real life.</h4>
    <p>
      How are data science, artificial intelligences and data science related to
      each other? Data science is considered one of the most demanding jobs in
      2021, according to Zita (2021). This is the work of finding useful
      information (also known as insight) from the original raw data through a
      series of steps such as extraction, preparation, analysis, visualization,
      and maintenance of information. AI and ML can help data scientists to
      make predictions and discover the patterns in data. To be more specific,
      AI is the process of discovering and learning from the data by itself,
      which could be similar to human intelligence. AI relies on machine
      learning, a part of data science, to draw features from algorithms and
      statistics.
    </p>
    <h3><i>3.1.2. The likely impacts of AI and Machine Learning</i></h3>

    <p>
      AL and ML can bring several positive and negative impacts on our society.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the one hand, AL (including ML) helps improve the operations of our
      workplaces and augment the work human can do. Moreover, it is beneficial
      to reduce operating costs and save money (Bernard Marr & Co. n.d).
      For example, machines created by AI can perform heavy human tasks in the
      manufacturing process, diagnostic of diseases are more accurate in medicine,
      or data and information are analysed to make more precise for risk
      prediction. These examples prove that AL or ML can give many advantages
      to improve the quality of human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, humans should consider AI and ML's drawbacks that affect
      their lives (Tai 2020, p.339) The development of AL and ML will make people
      more dependent on machines, so they tend to let machines do the work for
      themselves. In addition, when machines replace many jobs, traditional workers
      could be unemployed. Moreover, if the algorithm has trained the machine
      to operate the task, the machine is more likely to surpass human intelligence
      and perform the task without human control. Finally, bad people can take
      advantage of AI to create weapons to harm others.
    </p>
    <h3><i>3.1.3. How this technology affect to me?</i></h3>
    <p>
      AI and ML have had a significant impact on my life. Some applications can
      suggest almost precisely what I am looking for based on the user's existing
      data. Google Search Engine can quickly guess what I will enter in the search
      box and return many results pages in a second. Some eCommerce websites,
      such as Amazon, Tiki, Shopee, can quickly promote similar products for my
      parents to buy based on their purchase history. YouTube and Spotify do
      pretty well at recommending songs or videos that match the genres and
      musicians I usually listen to by applying algorithms. It is undeniable
      that AI and ML bring convenience to our lives, enrich our experience,
      and enhance our quality of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, besides the positive sides, AI also induces some limitations. In
      my opinion, I sometimes feel too dependent on technologies that involve AI
      and lose connection with people around me. Instead of discussing the
      problems with other people, I usually spend time searching for necessary
      information on the internet. In addition, data security is also a concern.
      In addition, many social networks, such as Facebook or Instagram, give me
      unwanted adverts, which can result from analysing my data.
    </p>
    <h2>3.2. Internet of Things</h2>
    <h3><i>3.2.1. Definition</i></h3>
      <p>
        Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the outstanding IT trends of 2021.
        As Clark (2016) explains, IoT is a giant system that connects devices
        via the Internet, from which people can transfer their data and monitor
        those devices through the network. Nowadays, IoT is more and more popular
        with the development of technology and the Internet.
      </p>
      <img src="Figure4.png">
      <h4>Figure 4: IoT application distribution (Zhang, Alharbe & Atkins 2017)</h4>
      <p>
        The pie chart above shows the distribution of IoT applications in 8
        different sections. This chart shows that IoT is mainly used in Smart
        Cities, Industrial IoT, and Connected Health, with percentages of around
         25 percent for each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many predictions about IoT trends in the future. According to
        Robotics & Automation News (2021), IoT will broadly apply to develop
        Voice Assistant Technology, Smart Cities, Education, and Healthcare until
        2025. More and more families will own smart devices like Alexa or
        Google Home, as illustrated by 500 million in 2023. In addition, smart
        cities construction will also involve IoT, which helps to manage cities
        and other resources effectively and reduces crime and other urban
        problems, bringing comfortable life for citizens. As for education,
        according to Meola (2021), IoT helps schools manage students effectively,
        create a safe learning environment, and support teachers in teaching.
        In healthcare, the sensors in medical devices will work correctly, the
        data collected from the device is used to predict diseases more
        accurately. Those are the trends of IoT in the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many advanced technologies can make IoT possible, which includes sensor
        technology, connectivity, cloud computing platform, machine learning and
        analytics, conversational artificial intelligence (Oracle n.d). Sensors
        must be affordable and reliable, while a network protocol host must
        enable sensors to connect and transfer data quickly. Cloud platforms
        need to make it easy for users to access the infrastructure they need.
        Finally, users can immediately gather insights from the massive amount
        of data sources stored in the cloud with the help of IoT and advanced
        AI technologies.
      </p>
      <p>In my opinion, I believe that IoT knowledge could improve my project,
        since this technology is essential for contact tracing and managing
        COVID-19 patients, as argued by Choudhary (2020).
      </p>
    <h3><i>3.2.2. The likely impacts of Internet of Things</i></h3>
    <p>
      The Internet of Things can have both positive and negative effects on
      society (KeyInfo 2016). On the positive side, IoT brings many benefits
      such as automation, efficiency, cost-saving, communication. The most
      typical example is the Nest learning 3rd generation Thermostat technology
      product, which helps users monitor and use the amount of heat and energy
      consumed in the home economically (Google Nest 2015). In addition, Digi
      Remote Manager is one of the products applied to smart cities, helping to
      manage and solve traffic, traffic, energy, and waste problems (Locke 2018).
      These are typical examples of many benefits that IoT can bring to our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as regard by KeyInfo (2016), some IoT-related issues can affect
      people's lives, including privacy and security, compatibility, complexity,
       fewer jobs, and technologically dependent lives. In particular, IoT
       security is one of the major concerns today, as the growth of IoT goes
       hand in hand with security challenges (Chaturvedi 2018). In addition,
       like AI, IoT also makes unskilled workers lose their jobs. According to
       The Economist (2018), about 8 different industry groups will be affected
       by automation with a probability greater than 50%. Those are some of the
       problems that people need to face as IoT becomes explosive in this century.
    </p>
    <h3><i>3.2.3. How this technology affect to me?</i></h3>
    <p>
      In my opinions, IoT technology has changed our life significantly to make
      it more convenient and comfortable. For example, in my family there are
      smart electronic devices that can be monitored by using voice, such as
      vacuum cleaners, smart TVs and air purifiers. My father uses a wearable
      device (Apple Watch) to check his health condition (heart rate, count his
      steps per day), and this device also connect and transfer the data to his
      iPhone. I believe that in the future, my family will use more and more
      devices with IoT technology. However, as mentioned above, the security
      issue of the above devices is a concern because many IoT devices do not
      have sufficient cybersecurity protection. As a result, the hackers could
      break into them to steal my personal information and use it for the wrong
      purpose. Therefore, I need to raise my awareness and gain more IT knowledge
      to handle this problem.
